[History of changes](History.md)

## Idea

The basic idea of this extension is to change the behavior of ReSharper's [static nullability analysis](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/help/Code_Analysis__Code_Annotations.html) so that specific code elements get a default nullability annotation without specifying an explicit `[NotNull]` or `[CanBeNull]` attribute. For example, reference types in method parameters are by default `[NotNull]` (‚Üí they need an explicit `[CanBeNull]` to become nullable).

![Code Sample](/Doc/Sample.png)

With enabled _Implicit Nullability_ for specific, [configurable](#configuration), syntax elements, the following rules apply.

<!-- duplicated in the options page -->
 * Reference types are by default implicitly `[NotNull]`.
 * Their nullability can be overridden with an explicit `[CanBeNull]` attribute. 
 * Optional method parameters with a `null` default value are implicitly `[CanBeNull]`.

In a nutshell, the code showed in the picture above  ...
```C#
public string Bar(string a, [CanBeNull] string b, string c = null)
{
    // ...
}
```
... implicitly becomes ...
```C#
[NotNull]
public string Bar([NotNull] string a, [CanBeNull] string b, [CanBeNull] string c = null)
{
    // ...
}
```

### `[NotNull]` as default

Without this extension the default nullability value is "unknown" which means that ReSharper excludes these elements for its nullability analysis. As a result of the changed default nullability of this extension we have to place `[CanBeNull]` annotations only for _specific_ code elements (e.g. a reference type parameter where it should be allowed to pass `null` as argument) and don't need explicit annotations for the majority of cases (in code bases which try to reduce passing `null` references to a minimum).

### Async method return types (requires ReSharper 9.2)

ReSharper 9.2 [introduced](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-376091) support for nullability analysis for `async` (`Task<T>` return typed) methods. With enabled _Implicit Nullability_ for method return values, `Task<T>` return typed methods also become implicitly `[ItemNotNull]` (ReSharper uses this attribute to refer to the _value_ of `Task<T>`). For nullable `Task<T>` return values, this can be overridden with `[ItemCanBeNull]`.

### Improves static analysis quality

The following example program contains a potential `NullReferenceException` in `command‚Äã.Equals‚Äã("Hello")` because the programmer missed that `GetCommand()` could also return `null`.

```C#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string command = GetCommand(args);

    if (command.Equals("Hello"))
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}

private static string GetCommand(string[] args)
{
    if (args.Length < 1)
        return null;

    return args[0];
}
```

With enabled _Implicit Nullability_ this bug would have been detected by ReSharper's static analysis.

 1. ReSharper would warn about returning `null` in `GetCommand()` because this method would be implicitly annotated as `[NotNull]`.
 2. This warning would be solved by the programmer by adding `[CanBeNull]` to `GetCommand()`.
 3. As a consequence of the `[CanBeNull]` attribute, ReSharper would now warn about the potential `NullReferenceException` in the `command‚Äã.Equals‚Äã("Hello")` call in `Main()`.

### Improves documentation

In the example above _Implicit Nullability_ forces the programmer to fix the missing `[CanBeNull]` attribute on `GetCommand()`. This shows how the number of `[CanBeNull]` annotations will be increased in the code base and therefore doesn't only improve ReSharper's static analysis but also the documentation of method signatures (contracts).

### Fody NullGuard

Another goal of this extension is to bring ReSharper's static analysis in sync with the implicit null checks of [Fody NullGuard](https://github.com/Fody/NullGuard#readme). For example, this [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody#readme) weaver injects `throw new ArgumentNullException‚Äã(/*...*/)` statements for method parameters into method bodies using the same rules as _Implicit Nullability_. In other words this weaver adds _runtime_ checks for nullability to ReSharper's _static_ analysis.

## Configuration

_Implicit nullability_ can be enabled or disabled for specific syntax elements in the *Code Inspection | Implicit Nullability* options page.

![Options Page](/Doc/OptionsPage.png)

### Code configuration

_Implicit Nullability_ can also be configured by code, using a [`AssemblyMetadataAttribute`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblymetadataattribute.aspx). This has the advantage that the configuration gets compiled into the assembly, so that consumers of the assembly with installed _Implicit Nullability_ get the same implicit nullability annotations of the compiled code elements, as within the library's solution.

Example: `[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyMetadata("ImplicitNullability.AppliesTo", "InputParameters, RefParameters, OutParametersAndResult")]`

:warning: After changing the settings (either by code or in the options page), [cleaning the solution cache](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/help/Configuring_Caches_Location.html#dynaProc1) is necessary to update already analyzed code.

## Code inspection warnings

In addition to the behavior change of the nullability analysis the following code inspection warnings are provided by this extension.

* "Implicit NotNull conflicts with nullability in base type" (Id: `ImplicitNotNullConflictInHierarchy`)
* "Implicit NotNull element cannot override CanBeNull in base type, nullability should be explicit" (Id: `ImplicitNotNullElementCannotOverrideCanBeNull`)
* "Implicit NotNull overrides unknown nullability of external code" (Id: `ImplicitNotNullOverridesUnknownExternalMember`)
* "Implicit NotNull result or out parameter overrides unknown nullability of external code" (Id: `ImplicitNotNullResultOverridesUnknownExternalMember`)
* "Implicit CanBeNull element has an explicit NotNull annotation" (Id: `NotNullOnImplicitCanBeNull`)

For more information about these warnings (and their motivation) see their description in the ReSharper *Code Inspection | Inspection Severity* options page.
